# javascript-koans

Forked from the original javascript-koans https://github.com/mrdavidlaing/javascript-koans

Updated the set of koans to better suit my mentoring plan.

## Running the Koans

Simply navigate to the Javascript Koans folder using a file browser, and
double click on KoansRunnner.html.

Any browser will do, but for the best results Firefox or Chrome is
recommended. More stack trace information shows up for javascript on these
browsers.

The first error will be in koans/AboutExpects.js. Fix the first test and
refresh the browser. Rinse and repeat until all tests turn green.

The test runner used is [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) with a customized report viewer.
